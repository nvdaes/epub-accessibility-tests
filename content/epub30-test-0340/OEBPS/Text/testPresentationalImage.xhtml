  <h1>Impact of alt=quote endquote (empty alt) and role= quote presentation endquote</h1>

  <p>Many times decorative images are used on pages, sometimes called "eye candy." For persons using Assistive Technology  this can be destractive and annoying. To suppress having anything spoken, like the file name of the image, two techniques are recommended to be used on the same image. Use alt="", i.e. the alt is empty. plus use role=presentation".  When both are present, the person using AT should hear nothing. However, when only alt="" (empty alt) is used, the reader should be alerted that there is a graphic present and they should understand that the graphic was adequately described in the fig caption or the surrounding text.</p>
